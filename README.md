# My first web
Step by step

*Challenge Web - Day I*

My first web project already has its own responsive navigation bar

*Challenge Web - Day II*

Finish building the navigation bar. It is adaptable and functional on mobile devices. I also learned how to integrate jQuery and used a function to give functionality to the menu.

*Challenge Web - Day III*

I played and had fun with animations and CSS. I explored the jQuery and Javascript animation libraries. I saw tutorials of data structuring. Add a footer and use flexbox.
